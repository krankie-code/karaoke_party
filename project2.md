# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building an Express app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- Have at least 1 model with a schema backed by mongoose.
- Utilize full RESTful routes: Index, show, new, create, edit, update, delete
- Utlize an ORM to create a database and relevant structure
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML
- Utilize at least 1 "advanced" CSS technique (translate, transform, animation, etc)
- Be deployed on heroku to be accessible by the public!
- Include some form of responsive design
- Utilize at least 1 external api called from your server


BONUSES:
- More than 1 MVC Resource
- An additional apiv1 controller for your resource that responds to an apiv1 namespace that responds in json

ADVANCED BONUS:
- Create 2 models and embed one allowing you to establish relational functionality with your data

### Deliverables

Presentation day is **Wednesday June 1**. By then you should have:

- A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- A git issue submitted to the class repo with the link to the github and the link to the deployed app.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started 

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Begin with some static templates.** What do you want your app to look like? What kinds of links, buttons, UI features do you need? Begin with some static code you know you will need to implement functionality for.
* **Begin with your models.** Start by laying out what your data looks like. What tables do you need and what columns do they contain? How do all your different models interact? What relationships do they have?
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build. Let the user's actions guide you to a starting place.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blog
Create a blog system to write down your thoughts.

##### Wiki
Create a wiki with editable content.

##### Todo App
An app to keep track of things you need to do.


#### ALL PROJECTS NEED INSTRUCTOR APPROVAL
- MVP milestones and approaches
- Due diligence on testing an API before locking into an idea. 
- Well documented API.
- Choosing a bad API or not reading the docs, not creating a test app to confirm and verify the API works as intended, can lead to disaster!

### Project Evaluation Rubric

* __Project Workflow__: Did you plan out your project beforehand (user stories, wireframes, etc.) as specified above? Did you use source control (git) as expected?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors?

#### Mid-project checkin:
* we will be discussing your progress with you next week.
* please have the questionaire filled out before your scheduled time.
